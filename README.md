# PHYS 144 Experimental Analysis (Fall 2025)

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks consisting of Python code to analyze experimental physics data for the course **PHYS 144 (Newtonian Mechanics)** at the University of Alberta.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate the use of Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib) for data analysis, linear regression, and error propagation in a physics lab setting.

## Tools & Libraries
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
* **Software:** Tracker Video Analysis, LoggerPro

## Lab Summaries

### **Lab 3: Acceleration due to Gravity**
* **Focus:** Free-fall motion analyzed using Tracker software.
* **Objective:** To experimentally determine the acceleration due to gravity ($g$) and compare it with the standard value of $9.81 m/s^2$ using linear fitting.

### **Lab 4: Atwood's Pulley**
* **Focus:** Newton's laws applied to a pulley system.
* **Objective:** To analyze the motion of weights attached to a smart pulley and calculate the mass of the pulley to compare with the manufacturer's specification.

### **Lab 5: Diffraction**
* **Focus:** Wave optics and diffraction spectra.
* **Objective:** To record spectra of a Helium lamp and smartphone flashlight using a Red Tide spectrometer and a custom 3D-printed spectrometer to find the number of diffraction lines per millimeter.

### **Lab 6: Energy of a Pendulum**
* **Focus:** Mechanical energy in an oscillating system.
* **Objective:** To determine the damping time constant ($\tau$) by analyzing the exponential decay of total mechanical energy over time.

### **Lab 7: Springs I **
* **Focus:** Hooke's Law vs. Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM).
* **Objective:** To find the spring constant ($k$) of a rubber band using static extension (Hooke's Law) vs. dynamic oscillation (SHM) and compare the results.

### **Lab 8: Springs II**
* **Focus:** Mass-spring systems.
* **Objective:** To determine the spring constant ($k$) of a proper spring and use it to calculate the mass of an unknown object.

### **Lab 9: Oscilloscope**
* **Focus:** Waveform analysis of AC light sources.
* **Objective:** To measure the frequency of light intensity variations for an Incandescent bulb, Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL), and Light Emitting Diode (LED).
